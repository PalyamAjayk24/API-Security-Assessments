ðŸ§  What is BOLA?

**Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)** occurs when an API fails to properly check if the authenticated user is authorized to access or manipulate a specific object (like a user, order, or file).  
Attackers can simply change the object ID in the request to access or modify someone elseâ€™s data.
